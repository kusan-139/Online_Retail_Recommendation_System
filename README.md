# 🛒 Online Retail Recommendation System

This project provides an **Online Retail Recommendation & Analysis System** with two modes of operation:

1. **Normal Auto-Run (CMD Window)**
   - Runs analyses.
   - Generates **CSV outputs** and **charts (PNG)** automatically.
   - Non-interactive (batch run).

2. **Interactive Streamlit Dashboard**
   - Provides an interactive dashboard to explore data.
   - Includes popularity analysis, collaborative filtering, and frequently-bought-together insights.

- 🔗 Frequently Bought Together (FBT)  
- 🔥 Popularity-Based Recommendations
